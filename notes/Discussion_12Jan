Classification Tasks:
        1. based on RSA (solvant accessibility)
        2. secondary structure (if an AA is a part of alpha helix or beta sheet)
        3. Hard problem (predicting center AA)
        4. noisy problem (identifying center AA in the presence of other residues) both Zernike and Hermite 
        5. tetris noisy problem (identifying center tetris piece in the presence of other pieces)
        6. easy problem (tetris or AA classification based on shape)
        7. Amino acid encoding (20 channels) instead of atom encoding
        8. neural network regression based on presence and absence of AAs in a neighborhood with a bunch of arbitrary orderings (e.g. closest neighbors) -- easy encoding
                8.1 number of AA within a distance
                8.2 vector of identities ordered based on their relative distace
                8.3 some encoding of pairwise distances and AAs
                ....
        9. learn a equvariant network with zernike input in which the weights are not dependent on "n", i.e., w_{nl}= w_l for all n's.  
        10. R_{nl} w_{nl} Y_{lm})--> Clebsch-Gordon nonlinearity on Y_{lm} on all layers+ Relu nonlinearity on R_{nl} at the first layer 
        11. nonlinearity on the R function operating in a normal neural net set up. These transformations are done in parallel to the equivariant net.
        
debugging issues:
        1. look at mis-classified AA, are they faulty in some sense? 
        2. multiple n (Zernike) classification for easy tetris (with and without scaling the input)
        3. Inverse projection for a specific "n" for a given neighborhood (tetris or AA); what n we need?
        4. TSNE or UMAP for invariants of Zernike (power) to see how AA's cluster
        
       
Hermites:       
        4. Inverse projection for Hermite to reconstruct the image (based on all the coefficients)
        5. Andrew writing some notes
        6. TSNE on Hermite invariants for different AAs
        

longer term debugging plan:
        1. reconstruction based on holograms (inverse problem)
