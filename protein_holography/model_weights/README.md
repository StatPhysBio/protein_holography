# Model weights

This directory is intended to host model weights from the trained model from
<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.31.514614v1">Pun et
al</a>. Since these weights are too large to store on github, they will be
downloaded when the model is installed with pip specifically in the call to
<code>setup.py</code>.

Alternatively, they can be downloaded directly from
<a href="https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/38488937">figshare</a>.
